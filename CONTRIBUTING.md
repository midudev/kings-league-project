## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to the Kings League API! We appreciate any help, big or small, and are grateful for your time and effort. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project, as well as the process for submitting pull requests.

## How Can I Contribute? üòä

There are many ways you can contribute to the Kings League API, including:

- Reporting bugs and submitting feature requests.
- Writing documentation.
- Improving the test coverage of the codebase.
- Submitting code changes and bug fixes.

## Submitting Changes üõ†

Before you submit a pull request, please make sure to do the following:

- Ensure that your code follows the style guide for the project.
- Write tests for any new code you have added.
- Make sure that all tests pass.
- Update the documentation to reflect any changes (recommended).

## Pull Request Process üöÄ

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
- Make the necessary changes, and commit your code with a clear commit message.
- Push your changes to your fork.
- Submit a pull request to the main repository.
- The repository maintainers will review your pull request and may request changes or improvements.
- Once the changes have been made and the pull request has been approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

## Git Commit Conduct üìù

When writing commit messages, please follow these best practices:

- Use the imperative mood in your commit message. For example, "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug".
- Avoid using exclamation points or question marks in your commit message.
- Keep your commit message short and concise, ideally no more than 50 characters.
- Use the commit message body to provide any necessary context or details about the commit.
- Use prefixes in your commit messages to make them more semantic. Some common prefixes include:

  - "`feat`" for new features.
  - "`fix`" for bug fixes.
  - "`perf`" for performance improvements.
  - "`build`" for changes to the build system.
  - "`ci`" for continuous integration - changes,
  - "`docs`" for documentation changes.
  - "`refactor`" for refactoring changes.
  - "`style`" for formatting changes.
  - "`test`" for changes to tests.

If you've found a bug in the Kings League API, we would appreciate it if you could report it to us. To report a bug, please follow these steps:

3. Include any relevant details, such as the version of the API you are using, the platform you are using (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux), and the steps to reproduce the bug.
4. If possible, include any error messages or logs that may be relevant to the problem.

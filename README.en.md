## Project Description

This project aims to create an API and web page for the [Kings League Infojobs](https://kingsleague.pro) for educational purposes.

The API provides access to data for teams, presidents, coaches, goal scorers, and assistants in the Kings League, and the web page offers information on the teams, results, and rankings in the league.

### Technologies Used

To retrieve the data for the API, we use *Web Scraping*, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Hono](https://honojs.dev/), and the API hosting service [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) for building and deployment.

The web page is developed using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework and we use the [CSS Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework to style the user interface. We have also used the [Cherrio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) library to perform *Web Scraping* and obtain data from the **Kings League Infojobs**.

To test and validate the functionality of the application, we have used the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) testing library.
